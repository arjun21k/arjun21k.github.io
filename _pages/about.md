Hello! I'm Arjun, a third-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the University of California, Merced. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaoyi Lu](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/luxi){:target="_blank"} and my research interests include virtualization, cloud computing, and storage systems. Currently, I am working on projects related to storage disaggregation and persistent memory.
